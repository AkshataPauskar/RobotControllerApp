Robot Controller - A 2D Grid Navigation System
This repository contains the implementation of a Robot Controller that can navigate a 2D grid of known size. The robot is given a starting position and a series of commands to control its movement. The controller interacts with various obstacles placed on the grid, including rocks, holes, and spinners, each affecting the robotâ€™s movement in different ways.

Features:
* Basic Movement: The robot can move forward, turn left, or turn right based on a series of commands (e.g., "LFFFRFFLFFFFRLFFFR").
* Obstacle Interactions:
  * Rock: The robot can't move onto a grid cell with a rock.
  * Hole: The robot falls into a hole and is transported to a connected grid location, maintaining its direction.
  * Spinner: The robot gets rotated by a given number of degrees (in 90-degree increments) when it encounters a spinner.
* Expandable: The system is designed to be easily extendable with new robots and new types of obstacles without recompiling the code.
* Path Tracking: The robot's path is logged and can be printed out, showing all the positions it visited during its traversal.

Usage:
* The robot starts at a specified grid position and direction.
* The user provides a sequence of commands (L, R, F) to control the robot.
* The robot responds to obstacles based on the type it encounters.
* After processing the commands, the final position of the robot and its traversal path are displayed.

Unit Tests:
* The repository includes unit tests to validate the robot's movement logic, obstacle interactions, and grid boundaries.

Future Work:
* Multiple Robots: In the future, support for different types of robots with varied responses to obstacles will be added.
* Additional Obstacles: More types of obstacles can be introduced with appropriate handling logic, such as moving obstacles, teleportation, or damage zones.

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build and run the console application to test robot navigation on a 2D grid.
